# Huffman_Coded_File_Compressor
## Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm. 
### This program takes advantage of this and compresses .txt files. 
### It can achieve an overall compression ratio of: 8 bits/5.32 bits, or about (1.5 : 1).
### The main idea is to minimize the wighted expected length of code in file by means of assigning shorter codes to more often used characters.
